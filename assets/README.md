# Assets Directory

> The assets/ directory is used to add all the website's assets that the build tool (webpack or Vite) will process.
> The directory usually contains the following types of files:
> Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
> Fonts
> Images that won't be served from the public/ directory.
> If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend taking a look at the public/ directory.
